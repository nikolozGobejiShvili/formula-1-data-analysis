# Formula 1 Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Formula 1 data, spanning from the inception of the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1950 through the 2023 season. The analysis focuses on three key aspects:

1. **Drivers with the Most Points**: Identifying drivers with the most points in descending order.
2. **Most Race Wins**: Highlighting the drivers who have won the most races.
3. **Fastest Lap at Monza Circuit**: Finding out which driver had the fastest lap on the iconic Monza circuit.

## Repository Contents

- `f1_analysis.py`: The Python script used for data analysis.
- `most_points_drivers.csv`: Drivers sorted by the most points.
- `most_wins_drivers.csv`: Drivers with the most race wins.
- `fastest_lap_monza_driver.csv`: Driver with the fastest lap on the Monza circuit.
- `top_drivers_by_wins.png`: Visualization of the top 10 drivers by number of wins.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating the visualization.

## Getting Started

To run this analysis, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. You can then download `f1_analysis.py` and execute it in an environment where the Formula 1 dataset files are available.
